## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using BigML for the data set to find out answers to the following questions:

1.How much expensive the international calls are ?
2.what things lead to dissatisfaction among the telecom operatorâ€™s customers ?
3.how customer service call relates to churn ?
Let us consider the following scenarios for the further analysis of the data

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@mazilkhatib786/data-scientist-blog-post-4e655359d1d6).
